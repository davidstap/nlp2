Hi everyone,

We've created a Variational Autoencoder with Categorical loss. We hope that this helps you.

So, the resources for project 3 are now the following:

1. [Theory notebook](https://github.com/uva-slpl/nlp2/blob/gh-pages/resources/project_neuralibm/theory.ipynb) 
2. [Neural IBM1](https://github.com/uva-slpl/nlp2/blob/gh-pages/resources/project_neuralibm/neural-ibm1.ipynb)
3. [VAE with categorical loss](https://github.com/uva-slpl/nlp2/blob/gh-pages/resources/project_neuralibm/vae.ipynb) 


Lastly, if you don't have much experience with TensorFlow yet, you might want to take a look at [TF mechanics](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/mechanics).



Best,

Wilker & Joost
