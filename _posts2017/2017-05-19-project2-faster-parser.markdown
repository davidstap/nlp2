We created a new [notebook](https://github.com/uva-slpl/nlp2/blob/gh-pages/resources/notebooks/Fast-Parsing-with-Finite-Dx.ipynb) on faster parsing using a finite D(x)! Make sure to check it out, so that you can parse faster and use more of the data. 

Have a nice weekend,

Wilker & Joost

`Edit: we clarified the text about designing your feature function. Please check the updated notebook.`
