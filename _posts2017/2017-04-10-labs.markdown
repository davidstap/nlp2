Hello everyone,

our lab sessions are not strictly speaking "labs", they will serve different purposes throughout the course. 
Whereas core material will always be covered in the main lectures, a notable amount of complementary material/discussion will be offered or take place in lab sessions. 
Such sessions should help you progress with projects, prepare for certain lectures with more challenging technical content, etc.

We will always announce the [content of lab sessions](/nlp2/labs.html), so that you know exactly what's going on.
